  <h1>How to write a lab report</h1>

  <h2>Step 1: Identify Variables</h2>
  <p>Think about ALL the variables that can affect the system.
  [#variables]</p>
  <p>Choose ONE to change (:iv). This is the INDEPENDENT VARIABLE.<br>
  Choose ONE to measure (:dv). This is the DEPENDENT VARIABLE.
  </p>
  <p>All the others are called CONTROLLED VARIABLES.<br>
  List them here (;cv)
  </p>

  <h2 >Step 2: Title and Research Question</h2>
  <p>The title can be just a statement of what you will study.</p>
  <p>The Research Question should re-state the variables.  </p>


  <h2 >Step 3: Controlling the variables</h2>
  <p>Your Independent variable is (.iv). How are you going to <strong>change</strong> it:?
  (;ivvar)</p>
  <p>Your Dependent variable is (.dv). How are you going to <strong>measure</strong> it:?
  (;dvvar)</p>
  <p>Your Controlled variables are (.cv)</p>

  <h2 >Step 4: Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>You are going to increase the (.iv). What do you think will happen to the (.dv)?</p>

  <h2 >Step 4: Quantity of Data</h2>
  <p>What is the lowest value of (.iv) you will test? (:botrange)<br>
  What is the highest value of (.iv) you will test? (:toprange)<br>
  How many measurements will you take between (.botrange) and (.toprange) (:datapoints) </p>
  <p>How many times will you repeat the whole experiment? (:repeats)</p>

  <h2 >Step 5: Diagram</h2>

  <h2 >Step 6: Method</h2>
  <p>Describe how to carry out the experiment step by step.
  (;instructions)</p>

  <p>Step 7:</p>

  <h1 >The relationship between (.iv) and (.dv) (.ofa).</h1>
  <h2 >Introduction:</h2>
  <p>(#intro)</p>


  <h2 >Research Question:</h2>
  <p>How does the (.iv) affect the (.dv).
  Keeping (.cv) constant.</p>
  <p>(#shortmethod)</p>


  <h2 >Hypothesis:</h2>
  <p>I predict that as the (.iv) increases the (.dv) will (.dvhyp).
  (.hypdetail)
  (.hypsci)</p>


  <h2>Method></h2>

  <h3>Variables:</h3>
  <p>Independent Variable: (.iv)<br>(,ivvar)</p>
  <p>Dependent Variable: (.dv)<br>(.dvvar)</p>
  <p>Controlled Variables(s)<br> (,cv)</p>

  <h2 >Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>  (,instructions)  </ol>

  <h3>Amount of Data:</h3>
  I will take (.datapoints) measurements between (.botrange) and (.toprange).
  I will perform the whole experiment (.repeats) times and take the average.</p>

  <h2 >Table:</h2>
  <img  src="(#tablesrc)">

  <h2>Graph:</h2>
 <img  src="(#graphsrc)">


  <h2>Discussion:</h2>
  <p>My data is a (.relationship) which goes (.updown).
  That tells me that as the (.iv) increases the (.dv) goes (.updown).</p>
  <p>I think this relationship is because (.discuss)</p>


  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>I predicted that as the (.iv) increased the (.dv) would (.pre)</p>

  <h2>Evaluation</h2>

  <h3>Evaluation of data</h3>
  <p>My data are (.correlation).<br>There are (.numanom) anomalous points.</p>


  <h3 >Evaluation of method</h3>
  <p>I felt the method worked (.methsuc) because (.evalreason)
  The problems with the method are (.issues).</p>

  <h3 >Improvements</h3>
  <p>Instead of (.botrange) to (.toprange) I could improve the range of data between (.newlow) and (.newhigh). Instead of (.range) can take (.newrange).
  (.improvements)</p>

  <h3 >Further study</h3>
